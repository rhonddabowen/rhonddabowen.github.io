    <p>Te Kainga Reserve is a regenerative space that invites the formation of community by providing an uplifting public domain. The space features a range of public facilities including a community hall, a public library, a gallery, and a primary school. Each carefully designed to cater for a rich diversity of people. The built interventions take the form of bridge buildings. With living green roofs they are delicately stitched into a valley that has been carefully replanted to restore a flourishing ecosystem. This creates a vibrant space for local residents that acts as a nucleus around which a close-knit neighbourhood can crystalise. Te Kainga Reserve becomes the heart of Corstorphine.</p>
